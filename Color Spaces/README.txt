This folder contains an OpenCV code colorSpaces.cpp which takes an RGB image, converts into HSV, prints their header info and displays all channels separately.

This folder also contains another source code usingMouse.cpp which shows the (x,y) coordinates of the mouse pointer over the image. Upon left click on the image, it shows [R G B] values of that pixel. Upon right click on the image, it shows [H S V] values of that pixel.

This source code was compiled using Visual C++ 2010. Unfortunately due to the large size of the project, only the source code and the executable are posted here. To edit/recompile this code, you can create a new project in your favorite IDE (like Visual C++, Eclipse, Codeblocks, etc.), configure OpenCV 2.4.3 in it and include this source code.

The executable(s) can be found in the Debug folder. Please read the README.txt file in Debug folder for instructions on running the executable.
